\usage{
coll(o11, f1, f2 = sum(o11), n = NULL, fun = "ll", flip = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{o11}{numeric vector with joint frequencies}

\item{f1}{numeric vector}

\item{f2}{numeric, if not provided, sum of o11 is used}

\item{n}{numeric, if not provided, sum of f1 is used}

\item{fun}{character vector for built-in measures (see Details).
alternatively a custom function, expression, or call. if names are supplied,
they are used in the output}

\item{flip}{character names of measures for which to flip the sign, inteded
to signify negative association with two-sided measures}
