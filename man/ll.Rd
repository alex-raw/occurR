\title{Calculate GÂ² (log-likelihood test) from vectors}
\usage{
ll(f1, o11, n = sum(f1 + f2), f2 = sum(o11), one_sided = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{f1}{numeric or integer with frequencies of tokens}

\item{o11}{numeric or integer with joint frequency}

\item{n}{numeric or integer with overall frequencies if not provided,
sum of f1 is taken}

\item{f2}{numeric or integer with frequencies of co-occurring tokens or
construction if not provided, sum of joint frequencies (o11) is taken}

\item{one_sided}{logical if \code{TRUE}, repulsion is indicated by a negative sign}
}
\value{
numeric
}
\description{
Calculate loglikelihood association measures for vectors of counts.

\examples{
ll(c(this = 41, is = 32, corpus = 41, data = 12), c(12, 1, 0, 3))
